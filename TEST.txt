“CS121” and “wechat” are not contained in the given collection, 
and when giving such a query to my search engine will lead to an error page. I added an exception to handle the problem. 

Other queries performed poorly in terms of ranking. 
I changed my previous ranking which is based on tfidf to cosine similarity. 
Then I also reinforced my scoring process by increasing the weight of important words like title and anchor words.
